    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup all natural peanut butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup honey (agave or maple syrup if vegan)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all natural unsweetened applesauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon salt, if desired</li>
        <li>1/4 cup mini chocolate chips, plus 2 tablespoons for sprinkling on top</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray 8x8 inch pan with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl of electric mixer or food processor, cream together peanut butter, honey, vanilla, and applesauce until smooth.</li>
        <li>Add cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt; mix again until smooth.</li>
        <li>Gently fold 1/4 cup of chocolate chips into batter.</li>
        <li>Pour batter into prepared baking pan and smooth top.</li>
        <li>Bake for 18-22 minutes or until top is just set. It's okay if they look a little underdone; we want these to be fudgy! Plus, they are vegan so you don't need to worry about them cooking all the way through.</li>
        <li>Cool on wire rack as long as you can. Cut into 12 delicious squares!</li>
      </ol>
