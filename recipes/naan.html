    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>¾ tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp oil (such as olive oil)</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>Butter and herbs for seasoning (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder. Whisk the dry ingredients together.</li>
        <li>Create a well in the middle of the dry ingredients and add the oil and milk. Mix everything together until it forms a ball of dough.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for at least 5 minutes, until it becomes smooth and elastic. Add more flour if needed to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Let the dough rest for 10 minutes, covered with a damp cloth or plastic wrap.</li>
        <li>After resting, divide the dough into 8-10 equal pieces and shape them into balls.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Roll out one piece of dough until it is very thin, less than 1/8 inch thick.</li>
        <li>If using a non-stick skillet, you can cook the naan directly on it. Otherwise, melt some butter in the skillet before adding the rolled-out dough.</li>
        <li>Cook the naan for about 90 seconds on each side, or until parts are blackening and it becomes golden brown. If desired, brush the cooked naan with butter and season with herbs like cilantro, garlic, or cumin.</li>
        <li>Repeat the process with the remaining pieces of dough until all the naan is cooked.</li>
        <li>Serve the naan warm and enjoy it with your favorite Indian dishes or as a standalone bread.</li>
    </ol>
